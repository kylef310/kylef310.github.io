<h1>Why I Chose UMaine</h1>

<body>
<p>As a High Schooler, I was never too picky about what colleges I was gonna look at. I always thought I wanted a career in engineering, and that's what attracted me to UMaine. I took beginner level engineering courses during my senior year of high school, and discovered that I didn't like any of it. I was excelling in my Business and Financial classes, so looked into UMaine's business program, since I had already decided I liked UMaine's campus, and location.</p>
