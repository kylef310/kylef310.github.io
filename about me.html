<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I've been participating in multiple hobbies throughout my life, some more intensely then others. Throughout my high school life, I played football all four years. Outside of school, I was a frequent visitor of Sugarloaf Mountain, where I skied frequently. Skiing and Snowmobiling are two of my favorite hobbies, which is why my favorite season is winter, unlike most people. I've owned three snowmobiles in my life. I find snowmobiling very fun, but I also enjoy the experience of buying and selling them. Snowmobiles are an expensive product for High Schoolers, and I think it's good experiencing handling the financial aspect of one.</p>

<h2>Jobs</h2>

<p>I've had three official jobs in my life so far. Right when I turned 16 I got a summer job at subway. It was a good job, but I had to quit when fall came around, due to football taking up too much time. I then worked for my father's friend, at his commercial cleaning company. I've been working steadily there for three years now. In the summer after my senior year in High School, I worked at Hadlock Field concessions as a second job. In August I moved up to the University of Maine, and I'm currently not working.</p>
